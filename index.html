        <p>
            Welcome to WDD 130! This page will become my homepage for the course.
            I love learning in this class and can't wait to learn more.
            So far html is an amazing class that I enjoy so much.
            One of my favorite things to do when I have free time is spend time traveling with my family.
            I also enjoy painting and camping, love all the outdoors.
            As a young girl I used to love to play with computers and learns as much as possible from them,
            but it was a hard thing since where I am from we were a little behind on technology, now I have the change
            to learn.

            Utah is known for its stunning national parks, red rock formations,
            and outdoor adventures. From the snow-covered mountains to the deserts of
            Moab, it's a state full of natural beauty and variety.
